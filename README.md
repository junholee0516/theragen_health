# Pangenomics_master_files_260610

This project contains master files for testing and managing the PangenomiX Chip-based CNV analysis pipeline.

This document describes the structure used to manage PangenomiX CNV analysis scripts, prepare the APT-based command line analysis environment, and generate files that can be uploaded to Axiom Analysis Suite based on APT output.

│       └── AxiomGT1.summary.a5
└── README.md
```

`apt_2.12.0_linux_64_x86_binaries.zip` is the downloaded APT package.
`apt_2.12.0_linux_64_x86_binaries/` is the extracted APT binary directory.

The following files should be removed after preparing the template files.

```text
genotyping_cel_files
AxiomAnalysisSuiteData/sample_info.bin
CNData/AxiomHMM.cnv.a5
```

---

## 2. Purpose

This project is used to organize the PangenomiX CNV analysis environment and to generate Axiom Analysis Suite upload-compatible files from APT-based command line analysis results.

The main purposes are:

* Management of PangenomiX CNV analysis scripts
* Organization of the APT-based command line analysis environment
* Generation of Axiom Analysis Suite upload files based on APT results

---

## 3. Required Software and Files

The following software and files are required to run the CNV pipeline.

```text
1. Axiom Analysis Suite
2. Axiom_PangenomiX.r1 library package
3. Analysis Power Tools
4. Output folder generated during or after an AxAS run
5. Demo CEL file or actual CEL file
```

Notes:

* CEL files are used when running analysis in Axiom Analysis Suite.
* The `Output` folder generated during or after an AxAS run should be copied into `input/axas_template_files/`.
* However, `genotyping_cel_files`, `sample_info.bin`, and `AxiomHMM.cnv.a5` should be removed after preparing the template files.

## 7. Input Folder Preparation

The `input/axas_template_files/` folder should be prepared by copying files generated during an Axiom Analysis Suite run.

In Axiom Analysis Suite, upload a demo CEL file or actual CEL file and start the analysis run.

During or after the AxAS run, output files are generated in the following default path.

```text
C:\Users\Public\Documents\AxiomAnalysisSuite\Output
```

When a demo CEL file or actual CEL file is run, a folder similar to the following is created.

```text
C:\Users\Public\Documents\AxiomAnalysisSuite\Output\<Demo_CEL_file_or_actual_CEL_file_name>
```

`<Demo_CEL_file_or_actual_CEL_file_name>` is not a fixed folder name.
It depends on the demo CEL file, actual CEL file, or analysis name used in Axiom Analysis Suite.

Copy the files and folders from this AxAS Output folder into the following project location.

```text
Pangenomics_master_files_260610/input/axas_template_files/
```

After copying, remove the following files.

```text
Pangenomics_master_files_260610/input/axas_template_files/genotyping_cel_files
Pangenomics_master_files_260610/input/axas_template_files/AxiomAnalysisSuiteData/sample_info.bin
Pangenomics_master_files_260610/input/axas_template_files/CNData/AxiomHMM.cnv.a5
```

The final input structure should look like this.

```text
Pangenomics_master_files_260610/
└── input/
    └── axas_template_files/
        ├── AxiomAnalysisSuiteData/
        │   ├── cel_headers
        │   ├── AnalysisConfiguration.threshold_settings
        │   ├── AnalysisConfiguration.analysis_settings
        │   ├── Configuration
        │   ├── batch_info
        │   └── user_colors.bin
        ├── CNData/
        │   └── AxiomHMM.report
        ├── Logs/
        ├── QC/
        ├── snpLists/
        ├── Temp/
        ├── AxiomGT1.calls.txt
        ├── AxiomGT1.confidences.txt
        ├── AxiomGT1.report.txt
        └── AxiomGT1.summary.a5
```

The following four files are generated during the AxAS run and may be automatically removed after the analysis is completed.

```text
AxiomGT1.calls.txt
AxiomGT1.confidences.txt
AxiomGT1.report.txt
AxiomGT1.summary.a5
```

Therefore, copy these files during the run before they are deleted, and place them in `input/axas_template_files/`.

---

## 8. AxAS Output Folder Structure

The basic structure of the AxAS Output folder is shown below.

```text
C:\Users\Public\Documents\AxiomAnalysisSuite\Output\<Demo_CEL_file_or_actual_CEL_file_name>
├── AxiomAnalysisSuiteData/
├── CNData/
├── Logs/
├── QC/
├── snpLists/
├── Temp/
└── genotyping_cel_files
```


---

## 9. AxiomAnalysisSuiteData Folder

The `AxiomAnalysisSuiteData` folder contains AxAS analysis settings and sample-related information.

The original AxAS Output structure is shown below.

```text
AxiomAnalysisSuiteData/
├── cel_headers
├── AnalysisConfiguration.threshold_settings
├── AnalysisConfiguration.analysis_settings
├── Configuration
├── sample_info.bin
├── batch_info
└── user_colors.bin
```

When preparing the template files, remove `sample_info.bin`.

The final structure should look like this.

```text
AxiomAnalysisSuiteData/
├── cel_headers
├── AnalysisConfiguration.threshold_settings
├── AnalysisConfiguration.analysis_settings
├── Configuration
├── batch_info
└── user_colors.bin
```

---

## 10. CNData Folder

The `CNData` folder contains CNV-related output files.

The original AxAS Output structure is shown below.

```text
CNData/
├── AxiomHMM.cnv.a5
└── AxiomHMM.report
```

`AxiomHMM.cnv.a5` is very large and can be regenerated during analysis.

Therefore, remove the following file when preparing the input template files.

```text
Pangenomics_master_files_260610/input/axas_template_files/CNData/AxiomHMM.cnv.a5
```

After removing `AxiomHMM.cnv.a5`, the final structure should look like this.

```text
CNData/
└── AxiomHMM.report
```

---

## 11. Logs Folder

The `Logs` folder contains AxAS and APT execution logs.

```text
Logs/
├── CopynumberAPT2
├── GenotypingAPT2
├── ParamCheck
├── AxiomWorkflowLog
├── DebugAxiomWorkflow
├── CopynumberAPT2.errors
└── ParamCheck.errors
```

These files can be used to check whether the analysis was completed successfully or to troubleshoot pipeline errors.

The log files generated by this pipeline may differ from those generated by AxAS.
However, differences in log files do not affect result viewing or analysis in Axiom Analysis Suite.

---

## 12. QC Folder

The `QC` folder may be generated but can be empty.

```text
QC/
```

---

## 13. snpLists Folder

The `snpLists` folder may also be generated but can be empty.

```text
snpLists/
```

---

## 14. Temp Folder

The `Temp` folder contains temporary APT input-related files generated during AxAS analysis.

```text
Temp/
├── ChangedSCAxiom_PangenomiX.r1.apt-genotype-axiom.AxiomCN_GT1.apt2
├── Copynumber.APT2Input
└── GenoTyping.APT2Input
```

These files can be used as references to check the APT execution conditions used by AxAS.

---

## 15. CNV Pipeline Script

The CNV pipeline scripts are located in the following path.

```text
scripts/cnv_pipeline/
```

Before running the pipeline, check the current path and file structure.

```bash
cd /BiO/Pangenomics_master_files_260610
pwd
ls -lh
```

Check the script folder.

```bash
ls -lh scripts/cnv_pipeline
```

Grant execution permission to the shell scripts.

```bash
chmod +x scripts/cnv_pipeline/*.sh
```

---

## 16. Pipeline Execution

Example command:

```bash
cd /BiO/Pangenomics_master_files_260610
bash scripts/cnv_pipeline/run_master.sh <CEL_DIR> <RUN_NAME> [TEMPLATE_FILES_DIR]
```

Argument description:

```text
<CEL_DIR>
    Directory path containing the CEL files to be analyzed.

<RUN_NAME>
    Run name to be used for output files.
    Example: cnv_run_260611
    It is recommended to include the date at the end of the run name.

[TEMPLATE_FILES_DIR]
    Directory path of the input template files.
    This argument can be omitted if the current working directory is
    Pangenomics_master_files_260610 and the input files are located in the default path.
```

Default input template file location:

```text
Pangenomics_master_files_260610/input/axas_template_files/
```

Before running the pipeline, confirm the following items.

```text
1. Axiom_PangenomiX.r1 folder location
2. APT executable location
3. input/axas_template_files folder location
4. CEL file location
5. RUN_NAME setting
```

---

## 17. Input Template File Cleanup

After preparing the `input/axas_template_files/` folder, remove the following files.

```text
input/axas_template_files/genotyping_cel_files
input/axas_template_files/AxiomAnalysisSuiteData/sample_info.bin
input/axas_template_files/CNData/AxiomHMM.cnv.a5
```

Example removal commands:

```bash
rm -f input/axas_template_files/genotyping_cel_files
rm -f input/axas_template_files/AxiomAnalysisSuiteData/sample_info.bin
rm -f input/axas_template_files/CNData/AxiomHMM.cnv.a5
```
